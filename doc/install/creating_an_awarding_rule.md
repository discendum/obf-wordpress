# Creating an awarding rule

To create badge awarding rules you should have Open Badge Factory -wordpress plugin set up and a badge or badges created at Open Badge Factory.

If everything is set up, you should have a Open Badge Factory > Awarding Rules -menu item in your wordpress admin dashboard.

Awarding Rules -page contains all the ready to be issued badges you've created in Open Badge Factory. If a badge you have created isn't visible, make sure it is not set as a draft.

If you open an awarding rule for editing, you can choose from multiple earning options. The most flexible earning option is using required steps. You can add one or multiple steps a user needs to complete in order to earn the badge.

After you save an awarding rule, the badge associated with the awarding rule will be automatically awarded to users who complete the required steps.
