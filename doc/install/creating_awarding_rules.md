# Creating a awarding rules

To create badge awarding rules you should have Open Badge Factory -wordpress plugin set up and a badge or badges created at Open Badge Factory.

If everything is set up, you should have a **Open Badge Factory > Badges** -menu item in your wordpress admin dashboard.

**Badges** -page contains all the ready to be issued badges you've created in Open Badge Factory. If a badge you have created isn't visible, make sure it is not set as a draft.

If you open a badge for editing, you can choose from multiple earning options. The most flexible earning option is using required steps. You can add one or multiple steps a user needs to complete in order to earn the badge.

After you save a badge with awarding rules, the badge associated with the awarding rules will be automatically awarded to users who complete the required steps.

You can monitor user step unlocking process and achivements via the **Log Entries** menu.

You can also define meta-achivements by adding badges as required steps. Choose **Specific Achievement of Type > Badges > your badge** at Required Steps.
